## Full Transcript (Verbatim)

Welcome to our on demand and online games entertaining.

Now you can learn team sento anywhere, anytime and at your own convenience.

This is our first session in this series called Team Center Basics.

And today we will focus on faith and all of you.

I'm Norrish.

And I will be your host and guide as we explore all of her up lifecycle management.

Okay, then let's get started.

So in decision, we are going to explore and understand current industry challenges and how the alem as a solution is helping organizations and then exploit a bit on what is BLM.

BLM scope and BLM components and then summarize with VIENA benefits.

Then we will have a deep dive into understanding how yet the end images will fit with BLM.

And finally, we'll end this session with the holistic solution involving ERP, BLM and MERS Solutions, which will help organizations to transform and be a world class manufacturing company in this continuously changing world.

Industry is highly impacted with more requirements.

More needs and more wants from customers, forcing them to accelerate their innovation with new products and various does inclosing for a portfolio which has a direct impact on increasing complexity.

When these industries are targeting global markets, these products how to be globally compliant.

So automatically this increases for variants and does in fact complexity about all this.

Every industry is forced to speed to market.

If they want to capture market share, they have to be forced to market back.

If.

These organizations are still following traditional processes, which are manual paper based and seeded in nature.

This will have a huge impact on slowing down the processes and internal laws that Pompey took advantage.

So to survive in this competitive environment, organisations have to adapt quickly to changing needs and how to automate the process using the latest state of the art solutions.

And one such solution, which we are going to discuss is.

VLA Product Lifecycle Management Industries embracing the solid current industry challenges.

He's implementing it, PLM Solution PDM Solutions helps integrate people, processes, product and enable them to work in collaboration.

These PLM solutions are responsible Badagry for MPLX, productivity improvement of around 60 percent and PLM and Together Solutions are helping many organizations in accelerating growth and innovation and helping reduce costs and improve quality and productivity.

They're also playing a very important role market.

That is, they have like shotgunning time to market.

Has this because before BLM integrates product.

Process Life-cycle.

And people basically BLM is not a simple software to the concept.

It's a platform to manage and higher product lifecycle that to efficiently and cost effectively from hibernation, stage to design, and then to manufacture and supporting processes during service and maintenance till the product is decommissioned.

That is what we call it as managing and doing product lifecycle.

So let's get into understanding BLM scope.

As we said, BLM spans across the entire lifecycle.

So starting with Rick Redman gathering and planning then to Orenda and design, during which a lot of DNA analysis, then tooling and fixture design and managing those tools.

Then we enter into part planning or missioning and we'll end up in assembling those products during the assembly process, especially in automotive industries.

There's a lot of robotics in Ward.

With simultaneously dissimulation, environment.

Use it to validate and optimize the process.

Then we get into mass production and quality checks.

One of the perp is shipped, the customer, then BLM will be extended to support in service and maintenance efforts.

Has all these functions that a student film.

We call it as a BLM platform.

Apart from these functions and modules which you are seeing on screen, BLM platform collaborates with SEAL team, all four teams.

Some players hand dieser one manufacturing companies on a day to day basis for effective running of projects and programs effecting the whole supply chain.

Before when we look to film companies, we need to understand the entire supply chain environment.

These PLM systems should work in collaboration with internal departments, suppliers and customers.

The next important concept is change management, as we all know, change is the only constant in this world.

So the PLM system should mandate changes seamlessly.

Then the most important for PLM is working with existing third party applications like ERP CRM impious.

It must work with these applications to share data across organization and with other applications.

On top of this, we be the BLM platform, which consists of freedom section, wherein we deal with our debt management, mostly used to manage through CAD data, block materials management that we call into the bond management and configuration management and workflows basically used by audit department.

Then the program management comes into picture to manage the projects and programs.

And then we enter into the very interesting phase of digital manufacturing where we create process plans, the sequence of operations for form simulations to validate the process and then generate work instructions for shopfloor operators.

Then we entered into and services to cover and supply chain.

So feelin's fancy across the supply chain and across the organization.

So this is what is the different components of the.

So let's summarize the alleged benefits using PLM solutions has helped many organizations gain competitive advantage as complexity increases.

We achieve higher benefits from usage of film solutions.

To name a few benefits.

Film Solutions has a huge impact on productivity due to fewer errors.

So automatically that will be less crap and rework and improves quality.

This has a direct impact on cost.

By reducing costs and also on cycle time, by faster time to market with improved cycle, with better reporting capabilities, managers can manage resources optimally.

So these are few benefits are high level.

We can clearly emphasize because of usage of velum, solutions by many automations.

Let's expand our a view from PLM to other complementary solutions like ERP, which stands for enterprise resource planning, mainly used in managing, planning, procurement, work in progress, inventory, finance.

Hey, Chad.

And forecasting eyeglass planning and many other potent sections.

And then we will focus on MERS, which stands for manufacturing execution systems used in managing shopfloor operations.

So basically we classify.

He had to be azzi transaction driven solutions.

Verein Financial Work in progress in Ventana.

The transactions that handled ERP systems BLM as a data driven system where BLM is used to manage through the data processed, playing data management work instructions and so on.

And MERS as an event driven solution when real time data collection of the shopfloor operations like scheduling, despatching and execution, plus disorderly conduct.

These three systems should work in tandem to gain better productivity and more benefits for any autum in addition.

So let's explore.

How these three systems should work seamlessly to help any organization believe world class manufacturing organization.

We call this holistic view has we have hardly seen any automation which uses all of these three systems effectively here.

We will use typical automation process as an example.

We don't say this is the only way.

But we say this is one of the best way and Narvo nation can implement these three systems.

Let's start with the sales process.

Usually after completion of a successful sales, companies resume, but just out of this purchase order is converted to a production order with requirements, is sent to design team and also to the shopfloor or the production departments.

Then design team's job is to pitchin to create new designs, tools and resources like freak shows.

Then the manufacturing planning thing comes into picture to build putties plants, that is specifically a particular plant, and then the BELOVE material and the process plan is sent to yuppy.

He had to decide when and how many to manufacture.

And accordingly, they procured the raw materials, then one and the word cartridges are sent to shopfloor for the execution.

Shopfloor in place will gather.

What instructions?

Routing information from PLM system and perform the operations and continuously update the work in progress due dates.

Back to you.

In case of any issues faced, Schaeffler in nonconformists is raised and work is stopped till that is fixed by the district department.

This is one way.

All three systems work in collaboration.

We can achu through 30 radios and can build a world class manufacturing organization.

The last like will be more focusing on available PLM solutions in the market.

Top three viscously we call them the leaders and build them solutions that Siemens BLM does all systems and PTC.

Then the emerging or the latest entrants into the PLM industry are from Vegard nations like Adile, some Oracle SFP, PLN from Mississippi and Autodesk.

PLM 360 from Autodesk.

And recently, we are seen like many new cloud based solutions coming into picture like US and 4G, PLM.

This is all about like fuel.

The BLM solutions are available in the market.

So we are at the end of Decision and indecision session.

We have explored what is BLM, BLM components, Halem scope and holistic view of how to effectively implement ERP, the and Vietnam solutions.

So in the next session, he will start excluding Seamans PLM solution, which is Team Center.

We'll start with Team Center Basics, covering it on nine sessions and we are offering these nine sessions on themes into the basics.

Totally for free.

So don't forget to visit us for next session.

Thank you.

And bye for now.

See you soon.
