# Teamcenter Quick Start Guide for Epiroc
*Your survival guide for the first week and beyond*

---

## üöÄ Day 1 Essentials: Hit the Ground Running

### Your Digital Command Center
Think of Teamcenter as the "Google Drive of engineering" ‚Äì but way more powerful and slightly more complicated. It's where all of Epiroc's product data lives, breathes, and gets things done.

**First Things First:**
- **Active Workspace (AWC)** = Your new best friend (web-based, works everywhere)
- **Rich Client (RAC)** = The old-school desktop app (still needed for some admin tasks)
- **Your Login** = Your golden ticket to engineering data paradise

### The 15-Minute Power User Setup

1. **Bookmark These URLs**
   - Production Teamcenter: `[Your IT team will provide this]`
   - Training environment: `[Usually ends with -train or -dev]`

2. **Set Your Preferences**
   - Go to User Settings ‚Üí Display preferences
   - Enable "Show line numbers" (trust us on this one)
   - Set your default folder view to "Details"

3. **Learn the Magic Search**
   - **Ctrl+Shift+F** = Global search (works from anywhere)
   - Use wildcards: `*pump*` finds anything with "pump" in it
   - Search by part number, description, or even drawing number

### Your First Day Checklist
- [ ] Can you log in to Active Workspace?
- [ ] Can you navigate to your team's folder?
- [ ] Can you search for and find a part you know exists?
- [ ] Have you bookmarked your most-used folders?
- [ ] Can you view a 3D model? (If this fails, ask IT about viewer plugins)

## üîÑ Common Workflows: The Daily Grind Made Easy

### The "I Need to Find Something" Workflow
*AKA: Where did they hide my part?*

1. **Quick Search**: Type in the search box (top of screen)
2. **Advanced Search**: Click the filter icon for detailed criteria
3. **Browse by Structure**: Navigate folders like Windows Explorer
4. **Ask a Colleague**: Sometimes the fastest way (seriously)

**Pro Tip**: If you can't find it in 2 minutes, it's either named something weird or living in someone's personal folder.

### The "I Need to Create Something" Workflow
*AKA: Making new stuff without breaking everything*

1. **Right-click** in your destination folder
2. **Select "Create"** ‚Üí Choose your object type
3. **Fill in the required fields** (red asterisks = mandatory)
4. **Save** and celebrate your first Teamcenter creation!

**Golden Rule**: Always create in the right folder the first time. Moving things later is like rearranging furniture with glue on it.

### The "I Need to Release Something" Workflow
*AKA: Making it official*

1. **Check-in** all your files (no loose ends)
2. **Create Change Request** if required by your process
3. **Submit for Review** (usually via workflow)
4. **Follow up** (politely nudge reviewers if needed)
5. **Release** once approved

**Reality Check**: This process can take anywhere from 1 day to 1 month depending on complexity and review cycles.

### The "Something Broke and It's Probably My Fault" Workflow
*AKA: Damage control*

1. **Don't panic** (seriously, deep breaths)
2. **Check if you can undo** (Recent changes in your session)
3. **Contact your Teamcenter admin** (they've seen worse)
4. **Document what happened** (helps prevent future issues)
5. **Learn from it** (every expert has broken something spectacular)

## üí° Tips and Tricks: Insider Secrets

### Keyboard Shortcuts That'll Make You Look Like a Pro

| Shortcut | Action | Why It's Awesome |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| **Ctrl+Shift+F** | Global search | Find anything, anywhere |

### Hidden Gems

**The Right-Click is Your Friend**
- Right-click on EVERYTHING to see available actions
- Context menus change based on what you're clicking
- When in doubt, right-click it out

**Search Like a Detective**
- Use quotes for exact phrases: `"hydraulic pump"`
- Use wildcards generously: `*2023*` finds anything from 2023
- Combine criteria: part number AND description
- Save frequent searches as "Saved Searches"

**Workflow Wisdom**
- Always read the task description (it usually has important info)
- You can add comments to workflow tasks (reviewers love context)
- Check your "Inbox" regularly for assigned tasks
- You can delegate tasks if you're going on vacation

**File Management Magic**
- Name files consistently (your future self will thank you)
- Use the "Add Files" dialog instead of drag-and-drop (more reliable)
- Check file sizes before uploading (large files = long waits)
- Keep local copies of important files (just in case)

### The Teamcenter Zen Garden

**Folder Organization Philosophy:**
- Create a logical hierarchy (not too deep, not too flat)
- Use consistent naming conventions
- One project = One main folder (with subfolders for phases)
- Archive old projects to keep active areas clean

**Version Control Wisdom:**
- Check in frequently (don't hoard changes)
- Use meaningful check-in comments
- Create new revisions for significant changes
- Keep the revision history clean and logical

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls: Learn from Others' Pain

### The "I Wish Someone Had Told Me" List

**Rookie Mistake #1: The Forgotten Check-in**
- **What happens**: You work all day, forget to check in, and lose changes
- **Prevention**: Set a reminder to check in every few hours
- **Recovery**: Contact admin immediately if you lose work

**Rookie Mistake #2: The Wrong Folder Fiasco**
- **What happens**: Create everything in your personal folder, can't share with team
- **Prevention**: Always navigate to the project folder first
- **Recovery**: Move items (painful) or recreate them (also painful)

**Rookie Mistake #3: The Overwrite Oops**
- **What happens**: Check out someone else's file and overwrite their changes
- **Prevention**: Always check who has files checked out before working
- **Recovery**: Restore from backup (if you're lucky) or recreate changes

**Rookie Mistake #4: The Permission Problem**
- **What happens**: Can't access something you need for your job
- **Prevention**: Request appropriate role assignments during onboarding
- **Recovery**: Submit access request (and wait... and wait...)

**Rookie Mistake #5: The Naming Nightmare**
- **What happens**: Use spaces, special characters, or inconsistent naming
- **Prevention**: Follow your company's naming conventions religiously
- **Recovery**: Rename (if possible) or live with the shame forever

### Red Flags That Mean "Stop and Ask for Help"

- Any error message mentioning "database" or "server"
- Can't check in/out files for more than 30 minutes
- Performance suddenly becomes terrible
- Missing data that should definitely be there
- Any operation that takes more than 10 minutes

### The "When to Escalate" Guide

**Level 1 (Ask a Colleague)**:
- Can't find something

- Need to learn a new feature

**Level 2 (Contact Power User/Admin)**:
- Performance issues
- Permission problems
- Workflow stuck or broken
- Data seems corrupted
